    challenge: (
      <div>
        <p>Our personalized results were spot on. The results perfectly explained the feelings each employee had at work. We had someone tell us, "I knew these feelings subconsciously, but this report gave me the words I needed for my next one-on-one with my boss."</p>
        <br />
        <p>But that accuracy created a new problem: they felt overwhelmed with what to do next. We included suggested action items in the results, but making those recommendations truly personalized for every employee's unique situation was nearly impossible with static content.</p>
        <br />
        <p>People were left with great self-awareness but no clear path forward.</p>

    approach: (
      <div>
        <p>Instead of throwing more charts at the problem, we realized people needed something more like talking to a coach. You know how you'd bounce ideas off someone who knows your situation? That's what was missing.</p>
        <br />
        <p>We brought in our consultants, who are in the room every week with employees, to help us figure out what resonated in person. Our team trained an AI that could access each person's results plus some high-level team patterns (anonymized, of course) so it could give advice that actually made sense for their specific situation.</p>
      </div>

    solution: (
      <div>
        <p>We built a chat feature where users could:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
          <li>Ask questions about their results in plain English</li>
          <li>Get personalized advice based on their actual data and team context</li>
          <li>Practice tough conversations before having them in real life</li>
          <li>Figure out concrete next steps instead of just "be more collaborative" type advice</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    ),
    impactDetails: (
      <div>
        <p>The results were encouraging, but not immediate. We learned that even with better tools, employees and leaders are busy with their day jobsâ€”thinking about engagement and what motivates them at work often feels secondary to getting things done.</p>
        <br />
        <p>We also ran into the "blank slate" problem. People would open the chat and just stare at it, not knowing what to ask. This led us to explore guided prompts (similar to what current AI models use) to help users get started. Once they had that initial nudge, they could have meaningful conversations about their results and start making real changes to improve their work experience.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The feature helped bridge the gap between insights and action, but it taught us that good design means anticipating not just what users want to do, but also the barriers that keep them from doing it.</p>
